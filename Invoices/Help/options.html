        In this page you can define some settings for your company and your invoices. You have five lines to define the header of your invoices, Usually you'd put your company name in the first line and the rest would be filled with address, phone, email, website information. As you enter text in the fields, the header on the right will be updated to reflect your changes.

        You can also define the initial number of your invoices which will be incrementing by one. Define the percentage used for tax rate and the default terms of payment. Also, you have two lines for the footer of your invoice, one bigger for thanking the customer and other for fineprint or final instructions.
