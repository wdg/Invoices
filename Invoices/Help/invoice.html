    <h1>New Invoice - Entry Form</h1>
    
    <p>In this form you can enter all the information about your invoice starting by selecting a customer from your Customer's list. If the customer you enter is not in your list it will be automatically added for future use.</p>
    
    <p>There are certain fields that are automatically populated for you but they can be changed if necessary, like the invoice number, issue date, due date and invoice terms.</p>

    <h2>Entering line items</h2>
    
    <p>Once you entered the header, billing and shipping information, now you can start adding line items to your invoice. It starts with ten empty lines that you can change according to the products or services you sell, they are all optinal so they can be left blank and even used as blank line separators. If you need more lines or if you need to delete wrong items, you have two buttons [+] and [-] at the bottom of the table used to add or delete lines. You can also use shortcuts for new lines [cmd +] or to delete lines [cmd -].</p>
    
    <p>Totals are calculated and fields updated accordingly. Add some final notes and save your invoice in the database. Now you can send it by mail, print it or change its status to paid. Invoices with a past due date will change status accordingly to notify you of payments due.</p>
    
    <p>Remember to save your invoices so you don't lose your work. Also remember that deleted invoices can not be recovered. It is good practice not to delete invoices to keep the numbering in consecutive order.</p>
